Before run the scripts:
- remove the messages from the external data which are not core parameter from that station type (e.g. remove salinity messages from VOS stations).
- since we might remove all messages from some rows do the following replacement: replace ",4,"","  with  ",2,"",".
  This makes sure the QC flag is 2 when no messages occur
